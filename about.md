### Personal

I'm a <i>[potiguar][potiguar]</i> person born in 1993. I began coding only when I was 18 and had started my graduation in S&T — initially programming in C/C++. I believe that my first experience, and interest, in programming, though, was when I was 14 and I tried editing some [Wikipedia][wikipedia] pages using their Markup language, usually contributing with sports-related content (mostly tennis and football). It seemed pretty fun to add tables, colours, and references to pages and actually feel like I was contributing to something bigger.

It's probably also because of sports why I found me interested on data and statistics for the first time. As a huge football and tennis fan I was very interested about numbers on team/player performance (I kinda loved the [IBM SlamTracker][slamtracker]), and I was always trying to build <sup><sub>(very limited)</sub></sup> datatables using Excel spreadsheets, so I could check numbers about [Flamengo][flamengo] players, Grand Slams, or the [state football championship][camp-potiguar]. Since I knew nothing about data processing back then, it was a pretty useless (but fun) effort. This grew even more when I began following some American sports leagues (specially the NBA) where numbers are seemingly omnipresent.

While I was going through my headaches in college, I was already fond of data and statistics, and I was inclined towards working with computer programming, because I was good at (and liked) the programming classes I took during my graduation. It was only in 2017, though, when I realized that those things could actually come together. I was pushed into a university hackathon competition by a friend, and to put our idea to work, I had to study what makes a chatbot understand human words. After finishing 3rd at that same hackathon, I was awarded an internship to develop our prototype, and really started to dive into the <i>world of data</i>. Starting from an impractical rule-based prototype, I went to develop an intent recogniser using *convolutional neural networks*, an app to learn from, dissect and answer human questions, a functional database model that comprehended everything necessary to track and improve our model, and a web app to manage that same database. 

My chatbot was the most complete project I've ever worked at, and after I earned my bachelor's degree, I decided that I wanted to stay in data science for good. In 2019, I spent the first semester taking a few courses on the subject, and by the start of the second semester I got my first full-time job in data science, and I went back to the university to continue my studies, now as a Master's student of Computer Engineering, learning more about machine learning and using it in research to possibly help the Brazilian healthcare system.

### Education

+ **Master's degree**\\
2019 -- *present*: Computer Engineering, at UFRN

> My ongoing Master research is focused on analysing large social datasets about Brazilian families and births in order to find out more about the preterm birth situation in the country. By using **clustering**, **fuzzy algorithms**, and **predictive modelling**, we intend to have a better understanding of what could be causing preterm births and which populations are more at risk of going through that.
