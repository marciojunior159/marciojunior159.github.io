Hello! My name is Márcio and I'm from Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Currently, I'm working my way into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning.

### Personal

I'm <i>[potiguar][potiguar]</i> and I was born in 1993. I began coding in 2012, when I started my graduation in S&T -- initially programming in C/C++. I believe that my first experience, and interest, on programming was when I was 14 and tried editing [Wikipedia][wikipedia] pages using their Markup language, usually contribuiting to sports-related pages (mostly tennis and football).

And I believe it was also sports that got me interested on data and statistics. As a huge football and tennis fan I was very interested about numbers on team/player performance (I kinda loved the [IBM SlamTracker][slamtracker]), and I was always trying to build <sup><sub>(very limited)</sub></sup> datatables using excel spreadsheets so I could see numbers about [Flamengo][flamengo] players, Grand Slams, or the [local state championship][camp-potiguar]. Since I knew nothing about data processing back then, it was a pretty useless (but fun) effort.

I was already fond of data and statistics, and I was inclined towards working with computer programming, because I was good at (and liked) the programming classes I took during my graduation. It was only in 2017, though, when I realized that those things actually come together. I was pushed into a university hackathon competition by a friend, and to put our idea to work, I had to study what makes a chatbot understand human words. After finishing 3rd at that same hackathon, I was awarded an internship to develop our prototype, and really started to dive into the <i>world of data</i>.

Today, I'm learning and applying data science and machine learning in both my job, as a Data Analyst, and at my university, where I'm engaged in a Master's degree in Intelligent Information Processing <sub><sup>(Computer Engineering)</sup></sub>.
